# Digital_Twins_Framework_For_Motorways
A Framework for Building Digital Twins of Motorway Scenarios

## Dependancies ##
This project requires SUMO, a microscophic traffic simulator: https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/

This project also requires the configuration files for the M50 SUMO simulation created as part of a paper by Maxime Gueriau and Ivana Dusparic titled 'Quantifying the impact of connected and autonomous vehicles on traffic efficiency and safety in mixed traffic'

Paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9294174
Github: https://github.com/maxime-gueriau/ITSC2020_CAV_impact

This Project also requires the communication meachanism for data collection
